         <b>About Me</b>
      </h1>
      <div class="pargraph-block-1">
          <p>
            My name is Philip Fraher or my username (PhilipModDev). 
            Software engineering and computer science are very fascinating subjects to me. 
            To consider such knowledge to learn, the creativity to build machine architectures in order to have complex applications. 
            The effect that it gives to the modern age has proven to help humanity over the past 20 years is amazing. 
            But seeing the gift of solving complex tasks by computing a program. 
            For instance website, web applications, client and server communication and much more. 
            Ever since I was 13 years old when I got my first <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-5i-Pro-i5-11300H-Keyboard/dp/B09PHYDXCW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GYLYGO3AQ2I&keywords=Intel%2BCore%2Bi5%2C%2BNvidia%2BMX%2B350%2C%2B8GB%2BRam&qid=1700103396&sprefix=intel%2Bcore%2Bi5%2C%2Bnvidia%2Bmx%2B350%2C%2B8gb%2Bram%2Caps%2C150&sr=8-1&th=1">laptop</a>, games, websites and operating systems were thought of as mystery to me.
          </p>
          <p>
             Especially Minecraft, it was one of my favorite sandbox games that I would still play along with <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story</a>. 
          The infinite worlds and procedural terrain generation struck me with amazement.
          But asking the question “how is this all created?” in a simple form to what my mind could understand at the time. 
          But later I got more enthused by popular mods. Such as JEI or dungeon mods. 
          It inspired me to have a passion for creating mods of my own. 
          The First programming language I chose was JavaScript. 
          Even though at the time I didn't know much about programming languages nor did I understand it's a tool for certain purposes. 
          But only going off others advice to find what language was suitable for beginners. 
           </p>
           <p>
            After obtain my feel on what it's like to program a computer I eventually switched to Java, so I found it more challenging to learn but I enjoyed the syntax of it. 
            After studying Java for about a year I began to develop <a href="https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ruins"> Philip's Ruins</a> to publish it on curseforge and other platforms. 
            The mod became a big success reaching over 3.6 million downloads on curseforge at the time of writing this.
           </p>

            Of course my creativity for learning and programming applications did not stop here. 
            But only more motivated to create more. 
            As I felt to myself that Minecraft was lacking content ever since the game was sold to Microsoft. 
            The idea of creating my own game came to me, knowing that would be such a massive project to do. 
            But with little experience I had, I started creating 2d games in Java’s AWT component. 
            Later I eventually forgot about the project, so I moved to something that is more of my interest.
           That was OpenGL.

            The experiences that I obtained over the years is a selection of subjects in the computer 
            science industry among others.
            Such as skills listed  for experience subjects:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Java</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Java Core</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Json</strong></li>
            <li><strong>OpenGL ES</strong></li>
            <li><strong>OpenGL</strong></li> 
            <li><strong>Libgdx</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Java Networking</strong></li>   
            <li><strong>Java Swing</strong></li>  
           </ul>
           Skills in familiar subjects:
           <ul>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong></li>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Java Netty framework</strong></li>
            <li><strong>IT Troubleshooting</strong></li> 
            <li><strong>Computer Hardware</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Customer service</strong></li>   
            <li><strong>Working with a team</strong></li>  
           </ul>
           In relation to website design, it is one of my newest skills that I've learned. 
           The current viewing website is built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
           I've built a demo web page before, as for practice.
           Since it doesn't really contain as many details as current.
          </p>
           <p>
            Java is one of my second programming languages that I've learned since JavaScript.
            Other than Java itself I've tried C++. 
            But I never really appreciated the syntax of it. 
            Plus the beginner’s level at the time wasn't suitable.
            So I decided to stick with Java and JavaScript.
            Both languages I enjoyed the syntax as I find it much easier to read rather than C++. 
            I know that I haven't explored many other languages but currently I still consider Java to be my favorite language to work with.

          <P>
            In consideration to computer hardware and understanding the components of the machine. 
            I've built my own computer and many for my friends. 
            To me, knowing the basics of computer hardware is considered to be an important aspect for software engineering. 
            It's the advantage of knowing what's operating and on how the machine does it. 
            It could result in an understanding of how to build your application. 
            As many application requirements use system resources, it helps to know what they are so you can develop the best performance possible. 
            For instance, knowing the type of CPU and GPU is important for software terms.
